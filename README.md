# list-my-music
Create a sorted numbered  list of my Music files

## The generated file helps me keep track of my current Playlist and music collection.

The python script is to be run from within the QPython Android app.
Should also be able to run from any python 2.x Android terminal though only running via QPython has been tested.

*Note: created for my personal use but feel free to use if you find it useful too :)
It's my first *useful* Python code so far in Android.. I'm sure there will be more to come... :)
